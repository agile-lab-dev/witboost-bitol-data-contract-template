## Overview

Use this template to automatically create a BITOL Data Contract.

### What's a Output Port?

Output ports are one of the main components for the Data Mesh data platform taxonomy. They allow exposing the Data Product information to users using a well annotated and structured port, as well as handling access control.


### BITOL

**BITOL** is an enterprise data catalog designed to centralize, document, and standardize the main business data entities across the organization. It enables teams to access consistent, high-quality data definitions, improving collaboration, governance, and trust in data-driven processes.

Key features include:

- Centralized Data Catalog: Provides a single point of reference for business and technical data definitions.

- Standardization: Ensures consistent terminology and structures across teams and domains.

- Data Governance: Supports ownership, accountability, and compliance by documenting rules and responsibilities.

- Collaboration: Facilitates knowledge sharing and cross-team alignment on data usage.

- Quality & Trust: Helps monitor and improve data quality, reducing ambiguity and duplication.

- Integration with Data Contracts: Serves as a backbone for defining, validating, and maintaining reliable data contracts.
